There is no OS to patch with security updates, I can run a micropython script with much faster startup time and the Pico W has WiFi 2.4GHz for wireless communication. Primarily I started looking at these because they were both cheap and available. I'm sure there are alternatives which have been around for a long time. However, I have two kids and very limited free time. I find the community around Raspberry Pis to be a great help, probably everything I want to do has already been done before, problems encountered and solved. At this point in my life this is a significant bonus. I have a spare Raspberry Pi Zero W from another project which I could repurpose for this project, but the more I think about it the more a single purpose microcontroller like a Pico is better suited to this job.

From another Raspberry Pi 400, using Thonny is a great way to get started. I used to be a full-time software developer, using tools like VS Code and IntelliJ PyCharm daily. Compared to my experiences with MacOS and Arduino devices in the past which were decidedly painful, the Pi400 and Thonny are such a simple combination and do everything I need. Starting with the Raspberry Pi Pico official guide, flashing micropython onto the Pico was really well explained. No recompiling kernels or anything like that, it was literally drag-and-drop onto the Pico. It's impossible to brick a Pico, the bootloader firmware is in read-only memory so with a press of a hardware button you can always reflash a Pico.

I considered PoE which does make for a clean build with minimal cables. Looking at the official Pi PoE board though there seems to be potential trouble lurking. While the PoE HAT is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4 as well as the Pi 3 boards which were the latest at the time, the maximum current draw for a Pi 4 has gone up to 3A. Admittedly this is with additional USB peripherals and a peak load like at boot, but I don't want problems down the line with voltage drops. The PoE board can only deliver 2.5A max. Also my choice of switch delivers 55Watts max via PoE. Split this across 4 devices with an optimistic 80% efficiency in the PoE HAT and we're down to 2.2A max at 5V. The PoE HAT also generates heat right where we don't want it, right next to the Pi and it while it has a fan it looks to be a snug fit to the Pi board meaning heatsink on the Pi are probably also out of the question.

A PC PSU could potentially provide 5v power for the Pis as well as 5/12v for fans and a windows to view the LEDs which I will of course be fitting to each device, because bling!

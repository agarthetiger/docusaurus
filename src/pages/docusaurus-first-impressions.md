# Docusaurus first impressions

Why do I need to put the page title twice, once in the header and once in the Markdown? Oh well, not a big deal. Lets hope things get better.

## Blogs

I was hoping to get away from needing to have the date-time in the filename.

## Styling

Overall for absolutely no effort on my part the docusaurus-generated site looks really nice.

## Navigation

Where is the navigation for the "site"? Seems odd that by default there is no nav shown on the homepage. Maybe I need to create some folders first...

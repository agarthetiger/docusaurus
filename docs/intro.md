# ... and build the thing right

This site contains a tiny sample of my notes and experience I've gathered over my professional career as a software developer and DevOps engineer. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buildthethingright/). It started as a weekend project to learn about MKDocs and TravisCI. I've used this intermittently, I tend to favour my own python cli tool `hint` these days, but have copied the contents over into this new Docusaurus site as another weekend project.

Site built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) ![example workflow](https://github.com/agarthetiger/docusaurus/actions/workflows/on_push_publish.yaml/badge.svg)

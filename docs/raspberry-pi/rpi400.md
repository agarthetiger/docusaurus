# Rspberry Pi 400

## Notes on configuration

In lieu of having this automated, here is a list of stuff I've configured so far and some thoughts on what is stil to do.

Install minicom via apt, but not really using this anymore as Thonny is far better for talking to Picos.
Install 1Password extension into Chromium. Still want to troubleshoot the standalone debian installer as this downloaded but failed to run.

* Boot from USB SSD drive instead of MicroSD, like all my other Pi 4B devices.
* Overclock, as the integrated heat spreader is decent and overclocking is considered pretty stable to a point.
* Note down my troubleshooting steps, as a few times I've struggled to get HDMI output from this onto my 4K monitor.

# Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)

## Instance Types

`T` type instances are general purpose with a baseline CPU performance and burstable to higher limits. The `Unlimited` option allows bursting to above baseline performance for an unlimited amount of time. CPU credits are still accumulated for time spend below the baseline performance. You can choose between `Unlimited` to ensure the CPU will never be throttled or `Standard` to ensure you're billing is predictable, at the expense of being throttled when CPU credits expire.

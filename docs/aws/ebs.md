# Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

When provisioning a `gp2` volume, you must figure out the size of the volume in order to get the proportional IOPS and throughput. With `gp3`, you donâ€™t have to provision a bigger volume to get higher performance. You can choose your desired size and performance according to application need.

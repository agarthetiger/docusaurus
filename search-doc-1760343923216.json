Multiple provisioners can be specified in the Vagrantfile, the inventory trick with the Ansible provisioner can co-exist alongside configuration with the ansible-local provisioner to further provision the VMs on startup should this be required.

Unfortunately library code does not raise a script approval for an admin to approve and the code in question has to be added to a Pipeline job where the methods are called directly from a Pipeline job using &quot;Pipeline script&quot; or &quot;Pipeline Script from SCM&quot;. To address this, a pattern I have adopted is to include a Groovy Jenkinsfile in the shared library repository called script-approvals.groovy which makes all the method calls requiring approval. It is then easy to create a Jenkins job which executes this pipeline, which can be repeatedly executed by the team responsible for approving scripts until the script runs to completion. This is useful in environments where there are new or multiple Jenkins masters which a library will be used on.

When developing any library to be consumed out of site of the authors, two things which are paramount are good documentation and comprehensive automated tests. Testing Jenkins Shared Library code is possible, but there are not many examples of how to do this. We were testing lots of Java code and knew Jenkins could consume and display a JUnit test report in XML, plus the applications we were testing had builds running on branches and PRs which we wanted to for the Jenkins libraries also.

There is no OS to patch with security updates, I can run a micropython script with much faster startup time and the Pico W has WiFi 2.4GHz for wireless communication. Primarily I started looking at these because they were both cheap and available. I'm sure there are alternatives which have been around for a long time. However, I have two kids and very limited free time. I find the community around Raspberry Pis to be a great help, probably everything I want to do has already been done before, problems encountered and solved. At this point in my life this is a significant bonus. I have a spare Raspberry Pi Zero W from another project which I could repurpose for this project, but the more I think about it the more a single purpose microcontroller like a Pico is better suited to this job. In searching around for suitable temperature sensors the DS18B20 came up. I'm hoping these will prove suitable with a bit of thermal paste and insulation around the pipes and sensors. As long as the temperature readings are repeatable, I'd probably be ok with plus or minus a few degrees. I can see what the boiler says it's outputting for the water temperature which will be interesting to compare once this is built. I2C, SPI and one-wire are all quite new to me, so it was good to find tutorials and guides explaining each of them and even a guide for interfacing multiple DS18B20 devices with a Pico, which is how I intend to build this system.

From another Raspberry Pi 400, using Thonny is a great way to get started. I used to be a full-time software developer, using tools like VS Code and IntelliJ PyCharm daily. Compared to my experiences with MacOS and Arduino devices in the past which were decidedly painful, the Pi400 and Thonny are such a simple combination and do everything I need. Starting with the Raspberry Pi Pico official guide, flashing micropython onto the Pico was really well explained. No recompiling kernels or anything like that, it was literally drag-and-drop onto the Pico. It's impossible to brick a Pico, the bootloader firmware is in read-only memory so with a press of a hardware button you can always reflash a Pico. I ran through several tutorials starting from flashing the onboard LED to connecting to WiFi, reading the onboard package temperature and driving a small oled display. Moving on, I also found guides for setting up a basic webserver, and serving metrics in the OpenMetrics format which Prometheus can scrape. Feels like all the pieces are in place to begin to build this up. Problems can always crop up, but in theory this should all work together. Time to build the thing.

I considered PoE which does make for a clean build with minimal cables. Looking at the official Pi PoE board though there seems to be potential trouble lurking. While the PoE HAT is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4 as well as the Pi 3 boards which were the latest at the time, the maximum current draw for a Pi 4 has gone up to 3A. Admittedly this is with additional USB peripherals and a peak load like at boot, but I don't want problems down the line with voltage drops. The PoE board can only deliver 2.5A max. Also my choice of switch delivers 55Watts max via PoE. Split this across 4 devices with an optimistic 80% efficiency in the PoE HAT and we're down to 2.2A max at 5V. The PoE HAT also generates heat right where we don't want it, right next to the Pi and it while it has a fan it looks to be a snug fit to the Pi board meaning heatsink on the Pi are probably also out of the question. While I've not decided on my final power soltuion, PoE is out for now.

The open stackable Pi cluster cases didn't have enough environmental protection for my liking. A pretty good candidate for a cluster case would actually be a gaming PC case. A PC PSU could potentially provide 5v power for the Pis as well as 5/12v for fans and a windows to view the LEDs which I will of course be fitting to each device, because bling! Cases can also provide convenient hard-drive mounting too which would be a tidy setup. I don't want this cluster to be a huge power draw though if left powered on but idle. Often the PSUs don't have great efficiency and are optimised for a clean single rail 12v supply which would be wasted just for the fans which I don't want running all the time anyway. I could use a dedicated passively cooled high current 5v supply, but now there's less value in using the PC case. A shop bought PC case also isn't very imaginative or unique so I'm leaning towards a home-made enclosure. I have a Sienci Mill One CNC machine from their original Kickstarter campaign so I should be able to make something tidy. "},{"title":"Cooling​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Part 1 - Initial design","url":"/docs/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-cluster/part-1#cooling","content":"One thing I expect this cluster will need is active cooling. The cluster is based around four Pi 4Bs which even with the updates since launch will still throttle under prolonged high cpu load. This cluster has to work in my garage as well as inside my house, so needs protection from dust which means more enclosure than the cheap cluster cases provide. Enclosure is bad for cooling but as this will also sit next to my desk indoors this also needs to be quiet and only activate the fans when cooling is required. After much deliberation my first build will use a single Noctua 120mm fan to provide airflow across all the hosts in the cluster. The cheap cluster cases which include fans are connected to the 3.3v or 5v power GPIO pins and are therefore always on. This fan can be controlled by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal from the nominated cluster controller which will be monitoring the temperature of all the hosts in the cluster. The NF-A12x25 in particular will stop when the fan is set to 0% PWM duty cycle by the PWM fan controller. This makes it ideal for creating setups with semi-passive cooling that automatically turn the fans off and thus run completely silent at idle if thermals allow. In the fan specs it needs a 5v PWM signal and the Pi's GPIO pins are 3.3v, so I'll be using a SparkFun Logic Level Converter to drive the fan. From the specs sheet the rise and fall response times should easily be adequate for a 100kHz PWM signal which is more than enough for the fan.
